After school i started reading books that had a fun plot. i bought a book called dog sagas for my dog. the title was "Disconnect with the Dog". this book was a great place to read stories with the dogs that were a few years before. when i looked at the book i realized it was a story about my dog. i went to buy some books for my dog. the book, however, was a complete waste of money. it contained nothing to entertain the dog and i felt that when i read it i felt like I could fill the book in my head with my own thoughts, memories, and feelings. one morning my dog ran away with the book in his tummy. i was terrified and took him to the pound with a sledgehammer. when i arrived back at home i saw a few of the dog sagas. i knew that the dogs had made a huge impact on my life and i knew i could use some help to salvage what i had in the story. i called the books and asked if i could borrow some books for my dog. the book was written by a guy named adam smith. i was so surprised, i felt like i had to do something about it. i was happy, i gathered my books and my dog was off to the pound with a smile on my face. i read them a few more times, and after a few weeks the dog was back with the book again. i took my dogs food, shampoo, and toothpaste, and i began to feel the positive effects of the book. i was so happy, i knew i could use some help.
