When the sun was setting on a beach, a dog was chasing a ball that came along with the light of the sun. The dog would run in circles to catch the ball. As the ball would fly across the beach, the dog would roll it backwards. One day, a dog ran along the beach and found the ball that was tucked in the sand. The dog rolled the ball backwards, and on the way back to the beach, the dog decided to stop and fetch the ball.
